| [Towards Making Systems Forget with Machine Unlearning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7163042) | 2015 |This paper introduces the concept of machine unlearning — the ability for learning systems to “forget” specific training data and its entire lineage efficiently and completely, without retraining from scratch. The motivation comes from growing privacy, security, and usability concerns in data-driven systems. Whether due to user privacy requests, adversarial data poisoning, or removal of erroneous data, systems must be able to remove the influence of particular data samples quickly and completely. | |
